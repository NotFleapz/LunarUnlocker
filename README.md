# LunarUnlocker
Unlocks banned mods on hypixel and other minecraft servers
----------------------------------------------------------
THIS REQUIRES PYTHON. Download Python From https://www.python.org/downloads/

Open this before starting lunar client. After lunar client has fully launched (meaning you can join/leave servers) you can safley close the window

This file will disable your internet when the game is launching it, then re-enable it when it is fully launched. This is so lunar client can't communicate with their servers to see which mods are banned on which servers.

This is fully undetected and will not get you banned unless you state that you are using the banned mod in chat.
